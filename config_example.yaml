# Column containing the unique identifier for the PSM / peptide
ID_col: "ID"

# Column containing the amino acid peptide sequence 
# If modifications and/or residues before and after are included, they will be ignored (e.g., 'M.n[+42.021]PEPTIDEK2.A' = 'PEPTIDEK').
seq_col: "Sequence"

# Column containing the list of protein accessions matching the concatenated FASTA file, separated by semicolon (e.g., 'prot_123ab;prot_234cd'). 
# If left blank (""), the protein IDs will be inferred from the FASTA file. Please note that this is computationally expensive and will take time. 
# If there are peptides that do not match any protein, they will be removed.
prot_col: "Proteins"

# Column containing the positions of the first amino acid within each of the proteins listed in the protein column, indexed from 0, separated by semicolon. 
# If left blank (""), the peptide positions will be inferred from the FASTA file.
pos_col: "Positions"

# Separator
